% ============================================================
\begin{abstract}
Keyword spotting (KWS) on edge devices demands both ultra-compact models and noise robustness---requirements that existing approaches address through noise-augmented training or dedicated denoising modules.
We propose NanoMamba, an ultra-compact state space model (SSM) that achieves noise robustness as an \emph{inherent structural property} through three complementary mechanisms.
First, \textbf{Spectral-Aware SSM (SA-SSM)} adapts temporal dynamics via $\Delta$-modulation and $\mathbf{B}$-gating conditioned on real-time per-band SNR estimates.
Second, \textbf{DualPCEN}---a novel dual-expert per-channel energy normalization---routes inputs through stationary and non-stationary noise specialists using zero-learnable-parameter spectral features (spectral flatness and spectral tilt), enabling \emph{per-input adaptive} normalization at inference time.
Third, \textbf{non-learnable architectural guarantees} (adaptive $\Delta$-floor, $\varepsilon$-bypass, and $\mathbf{B}$-gate floor) prevent optimizer destruction of noise-robust properties during training.
We further introduce per-sample multi-condition noise-augmented training with curriculum scheduling, showing that NanoMamba benefits disproportionately compared to CNN baselines due to DualPCEN's dynamic routing---which separates clean and noisy processing pathways---versus CNNs' fixed-statistic normalization that forces a clean-noise trade-off.
NanoMamba-Tiny-DualPCEN achieves these capabilities with only \textbf{4,957~parameters} (4.8\,KB INT8), demonstrating that structural noise robustness requires neither large model capacity nor noise-specific training data.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

\IEEEPARstart{K}{eyword} spotting (KWS) enables always-on voice interfaces on microcontrollers (MCUs) and edge devices, where model size is constrained to sub-256\,KB and inference latency must remain below 10\,ms~\cite{banbury2021mlperf,lin2020mcunet}.
A persistent challenge is noise robustness: in real-world deployments, KWS systems encounter diverse and time-varying noise conditions---from stationary white noise (vacuum cleaners, rain, air conditioning) to non-stationary babble (cafes, offices)---that can catastrophically degrade recognition accuracy.

Conventional approaches to noise robustness follow two paradigms, each with fundamental limitations.
\emph{Training-based approaches} expose models to noise-augmented data during training~\cite{rybakov2020streaming}, but assume knowledge of deployment noise characteristics and cannot generalize to unseen noise types.
\emph{Enhancement-based approaches} employ dedicated denoising front-ends, but add computational overhead and can introduce artifacts that degrade clean-speech performance.
Neither paradigm addresses the root cause: the model architecture itself lacks mechanisms to \emph{structurally adapt} to the noise environment at inference time.

CNN-based KWS models illustrate this limitation clearly.
DS-CNN-S~\cite{zhang2017hello} uses depthwise separable convolutions with global BatchNorm, creating a single normalization regime that averages across all training conditions---at inference, the model applies the \emph{same} fixed statistics regardless of whether the input is clean or corrupted by noise.
BC-ResNet-1~\cite{kim2021bcresnet}, with its Sub-Spectral Normalization, captures per-frequency-band statistics---a step toward frequency-aware processing---but these statistics are still \emph{frozen} at inference time.
When broadband noise corrupts all frequency bands simultaneously (e.g., white noise at $-15$\,dB), DS-CNN-S collapses to near-random accuracy (11.1\%), revealing that fixed convolutional filters cannot cope with pervasive spectral corruption.

State space models (SSMs)~\cite{gu2024mamba,gu2022efficiently}, particularly the selective SSM architecture Mamba~\cite{gu2024mamba}, offer a fundamentally different computational paradigm: linear-time sequential modeling with input-dependent selection of which information to retain or suppress.
We observe that this selection mechanism---specifically the discretization step~$\Delta$ and input matrix~$\mathbf{B}$---can be conditioned on real-time acoustic information to create \emph{structurally noise-adaptive} dynamics.
When the model is provided with per-band SNR estimates as side information, the SSM architecture can inherently adapt its temporal bandwidth and input sensitivity to the instantaneous noise environment, without any explicit noise modeling or noise-augmented training.

Building on our preliminary work~\cite{choi2026nanomamba_interspeech} which introduced Spectral-Aware SSM (SA-SSM), this paper presents NanoMamba as a comprehensive system for structural noise robustness through the following novel contributions:

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{DualPCEN}: A dual-expert per-channel energy normalization frontend with \emph{zero-learnable-parameter} routing based on spectral flatness and spectral tilt.
Unlike learned noise classifiers, DualPCEN uses physically interpretable acoustic features to dynamically select between stationary and non-stationary noise specialists \emph{per input} at inference time---a capability fundamentally absent in CNN architectures with frozen normalization statistics.

\item \textbf{Non-learnable architectural guarantees}: Three register-buffer constraints---adaptive $\Delta$-floor, $\varepsilon$-bypass, and $\mathbf{B}$-gate floor---that provably prevent the optimizer from destroying noise-robust properties during training.
We provide a dynamical systems interpretation showing these constraints ensure SSM stability and observability under extreme noise.

\item \textbf{Per-sample multi-condition noise-augmented training with curriculum}: A training strategy where each sample independently draws a noise type and SNR level, combined with a four-phase curriculum (clean warm-up $\to$ gentle $\to$ moderate $\to$ hard).
We show that NanoMamba benefits disproportionately compared to CNN baselines because DualPCEN's dynamic routing separates clean and noisy processing pathways, avoiding the clean-noise trade-off inherent in fixed-statistic architectures.

\item \textbf{Runtime parameter calibration}: Four environment-aware profiles (clean, light, moderate, extreme) that adjust the SSM's adaptive constants at deployment time with zero parameter overhead.

\item \textbf{Spectral subtraction with SNR-adaptive bypass}: A zero-parameter classical enhancer combined with an SNR-adaptive bypass gate that preserves clean-speech quality while improving noisy-speech robustness.

\item \textbf{Comprehensive evaluation}: 5~noise types $\times$ 7~SNR levels ($-15$ to $15$\,dB) with DualPCEN routing analysis providing direct evidence of per-input adaptive normalization.
\end{enumerate}

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

\subsection{Small-Footprint Keyword Spotting}

The dominant paradigm for edge KWS uses convolutional neural networks operating on mel-spectrogram features.
DS-CNN~\cite{zhang2017hello} introduced depthwise separable convolutions for KWS, achieving 95.4\% accuracy on Google Speech Commands (GSC) with 23.7K parameters.
BC-ResNet~\cite{kim2021bcresnet} improved parameter efficiency through broadcasted residual connections and Sub-Spectral Normalization (SSN)---a frequency-band-aware variant of BatchNorm~\cite{ioffe2015batchnorm}---achieving 96.0\% with only 7.5K parameters.
TC-ResNet~\cite{choi2019temporal} proposed temporal convolutions for real-time inference, while MatchboxNet~\cite{majumdar2020matchboxnet} combined 1D time-channel separable convolutions with squeeze-and-excitation.
Attention-based approaches, including the Attention RNN~\cite{deandrade2018neural} and the Keyword Transformer~\cite{berg2021keyword} (built on the Transformer architecture~\cite{vaswani2017attention}), achieved strong accuracy but with $O(T^2)$ complexity unsuitable for MCUs.
The Audio Spectrogram Transformer (AST)~\cite{gong2021ast} demonstrated the power of pre-trained vision transformers for audio but requires over 80M parameters.
Recent system-level approaches~\cite{bartoli2025typman} have demonstrated end-to-end KWS deployment on embedded microcontrollers, highlighting the importance of hardware-aware model design.

A common limitation across these architectures is that their noise robustness is determined entirely at training time: BatchNorm~\cite{ioffe2015batchnorm} statistics (mean and variance) are computed during training and frozen at inference.
When the input distribution shifts due to noise, these frozen statistics become mismatched, causing performance degradation proportional to the distribution shift.

\subsection{State Space Models for Audio}

Structured State Spaces (S4)~\cite{gu2022efficiently} demonstrated that continuous-time dynamical systems with HiPPO~\cite{gu2020hippo} initialization provide an effective inductive bias for long-range sequence modeling.
Subsequent work on linear state-space layers~\cite{gu2021combining} and simplified S5 models~\cite{smith2023s5} further established SSMs as competitive alternatives to Transformers.
Mamba~\cite{gu2024mamba} introduced input-dependent \emph{selective} SSM dynamics, where the discretization parameters ($\Delta$, $\mathbf{B}$, $\mathbf{C}$) are projected from the input, enabling the model to selectively propagate or suppress information.
More recently, Mamba-2~\cite{dao2024mamba2} unified SSMs and attention through structured state space duality, and Orvieto et al.~\cite{orvieto2023resurrecting} showed that careful parameterization of linear recurrences (including stable initialization) is key for long-sequence modeling.

For audio applications, Keyword Mamba~\cite{goel2024keyword} applied bidirectional Mamba to keyword spotting on GSC, but targeted accuracy rather than noise robustness and required 3.4M parameters---orders of magnitude above edge budgets.
SSAMBA~\cite{shaker2024ssamba} explored self-supervised audio representation learning with Mamba, demonstrating competitive performance on AudioSet.
Neither work explored the potential of SSM dynamics for noise-adaptive inference.

Our SA-SSM~\cite{choi2026nanomamba_interspeech} was the first to exploit the connection between SSM discretization parameters and noise robustness: by conditioning $\Delta$ and $\mathbf{B}$ on per-band SNR estimates, the SSM \emph{structurally} adapts its temporal bandwidth and input sensitivity to the noise environment, achieving noise robustness without noise-augmented training.

\subsection{Noise-Robust Front-Ends}

Per-Channel Energy Normalization (PCEN)~\cite{wang2017trainable}, inspired by auditory models of human hearing~\cite{lyon2017human}, replaced static log-compression with an adaptive gain control (AGC) mechanism that Gaussianizes feature distributions, improving robustness to level variations.
Lostanlen et al.~\cite{pcen_lostanlen2019} provided theoretical analysis of PCEN's normalization properties, demonstrating its superiority over log-mel for non-stationary signals.
LEAF-APCEN~\cite{zeghidour2021leaf} proposed a neural controller that adapts PCEN parameters based on the input, adding learnable capacity for noise adaptation.
However, single-expert PCEN uses one set of AGC parameters that must simultaneously handle both stationary noise (requiring slow smoothing, small offset~$\delta$) and non-stationary noise (requiring fast smoothing, large offset~$\delta$)---fundamentally conflicting requirements.

DualPCEN addresses this conflict through dual-expert architecture with zero-learnable-parameter routing, using spectral flatness and spectral tilt to select between experts.
Unlike LEAF-APCEN's neural controller, DualPCEN's routing signal has a direct physical interpretation and adds only one learnable parameter (gate temperature).

\subsection{Mixture of Experts for Noise Robustness}

Mixture of Experts (MoE), introduced by Shazeer et al.~\cite{shazeer2017outrageously} for scaling language models, has recently been applied to noise robustness in speaker verification~\cite{zhang2025noisemoe}, where a learned noise classifier routes inputs to noise-type-specific expert branches.
MoE architectures have also been analyzed for robustness to feature noise~\cite{puigcerver2024moe_robustness}, showing that sparse expert activation naturally filters noisy features.

DualPCEN can be viewed as a minimal MoE with two experts and zero-learnable-parameter routing.
Unlike learned noise classifiers that require noise-type labels or noise-augmented training, DualPCEN's routing is based on signal-derived spectral features that correlate with noise stationarity by construction.

\section{Proposed Method}
\label{sec:method}

\subsection{Background: SA-SSM}
\label{sec:sassm}

We briefly review the SA-SSM framework from~\cite{choi2026nanomamba_interspeech}.
A selective SSM~\cite{gu2024mamba} processes a sequence $x_t \in \mathbb{R}^D$ via:
\begin{align}
\mathbf{h}_t &= \bar{\mathbf{A}}_t \, \mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \bar{\mathbf{B}}_t \, x_t, \quad
y_t = \mathbf{C}_t \, \mathbf{h}_t + \mathbf{D} \, x_t,
\label{eq:ssm}
\end{align}
where $\bar{\mathbf{A}}_t = \exp(\mathbf{A} \cdot \Delta_t)$, $\bar{\mathbf{B}}_t = \Delta_t \cdot \mathbf{B}_t$, and $\Delta_t$ is the input-dependent discretization step.
SA-SSM conditions two components on per-band SNR estimates $\hat{\mathbf{s}}_t$:

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{$\Delta$-modulation.}
The discretization step is augmented with an SNR shift:
\begin{equation}
\Delta_t = \mathrm{softplus}(\mathbf{W}_\Delta x_t + \mathbf{W}_s \hat{s}_t + \mathbf{b}_\Delta),
\label{eq:dt_mod}
\end{equation}
where $\mathbf{W}_s$ projects the SNR estimate.
Low SNR reduces $\Delta_t$, causing $\bar{\mathbf{A}} \to \mathbf{I}$ (preserving accumulated state) and $\bar{\mathbf{B}} \to \mathbf{0}$ (suppressing noisy input)---a structural low-pass filter.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{$\mathbf{B}$-gating.}
The input matrix is gated by an SNR-dependent mask:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{\mathbf{B}}_t = \mathbf{B}_t \odot \big(1 {-} \alpha + \alpha \cdot \sigma(\mathbf{W}_g \hat{\mathbf{s}}_t)\big),
\label{eq:b_gate}
\end{equation}
where $\alpha$ (learnable, init.~0.5) controls gating strength.
Under high noise, the gate attenuates unreliable observations, implementing a ``trust the prior'' Bayesian strategy.


\subsection{DualPCEN: Dual-Expert Noise-Adaptive Normalization}
\label{sec:dualpcen}

\subsubsection{Motivation}

Standard PCEN applies a single set of AGC parameters:
\begin{equation}
\text{PCEN}(x) = \left(\frac{x}{(\epsilon + M)^\alpha} + \delta\right)^r - \delta^r,
\label{eq:pcen}
\end{equation}
where $M$ is the smoothed energy envelope with smoothing constant~$s$, $\alpha$ controls AGC strength, $\delta$ is an offset, and $r$ is the compression exponent.

Optimal PCEN parameters conflict across noise types:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item \textbf{Stationary noise} (white, factory, pink): requires small $\delta$ ($\approx 0.01$) to enable full AGC division, effectively normalizing out the slowly-varying noise floor.
\item \textbf{Non-stationary noise} (babble, street): requires large $\delta$ ($\approx 2.0$) to suppress AGC division (which would track and cancel the desired speech), instead relying on offset-based relative enhancement.
\end{itemize}
A single PCEN must compromise, limiting performance on both noise classes.

\subsubsection{Dual-Expert Architecture}

DualPCEN resolves this conflict with two complementary experts (Figure~\ref{fig:dualpcen}):

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{Expert~1 (Non-stationary specialist).}
Parameterized with large offset $\delta_1 = 2.0$, slow smoothing $s_1 = 0.025$:
\begin{equation}
\text{Exp}_1(x) = \text{PCEN}(x; s_1{=}0.025, \alpha_1{=}0.99, \delta_1{=}2.0, r_1{=}0.5).
\label{eq:expert1}
\end{equation}
The large $\delta_1$ suppresses the AGC division effect, preserving relative speech structure against non-stationary interference where the noise envelope fluctuates rapidly.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{Expert~2 (Stationary specialist).}
Parameterized with small offset $\delta_2 = 0.01$, fast smoothing $s_2 = 0.15$:
\begin{equation}
\text{Exp}_2(x) = \text{PCEN}(x; s_2{=}0.15, \alpha_2{=}0.99, \delta_2{=}0.01, r_2{=}0.1).
\label{eq:expert2}
\end{equation}
The small $\delta_2$ enables full AGC: $x / (\epsilon + M)^\alpha$ divides out the stationary noise floor, recovering the speech signal even at extreme SNR.

Each expert has 4~learnable PCEN parameters ($s$, $\alpha$, $\delta$, $r$), totaling 8~parameters plus the routing mechanism.

\subsubsection{Zero-Learnable-Parameter Routing}

The key innovation of DualPCEN is that routing between experts uses \emph{zero-learnable-parameter} spectral features with direct physical interpretation:

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{Spectral Flatness (SF).}
SF measures the ratio of geometric to arithmetic mean of the mel spectrum:
\begin{equation}
\text{SF}(t) = \frac{\exp\left(\frac{1}{F}\sum_{f=1}^{F} \log x_{f,t}\right)}{\frac{1}{F}\sum_{f=1}^{F} x_{f,t}}.
\label{eq:sf}
\end{equation}
$\text{SF} \to 1$ indicates a spectrally flat signal (characteristic of white/stationary noise), while $\text{SF} \to 0$ indicates a tonal/harmonic signal (characteristic of speech or non-stationary interference).

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{Spectral Tilt (ST).}
ST measures the concentration of energy in low vs.\ high frequency bands:
\begin{equation}
\text{ST}(t) = \frac{E_{\text{low}}(t)}{E_{\text{low}}(t) + E_{\text{high}}(t) + \epsilon},
\label{eq:tilt}
\end{equation}
where $E_{\text{low}}$ and $E_{\text{high}}$ are the average energies in the lower and upper thirds of the mel bands, respectively.
ST compensates for misrouting of colored noise: pink noise has low SF ($\approx 0.3$) but high ST ($\approx 0.85$), which without tilt correction would be misrouted to the non-stationary expert.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{Routing gate.}
The adjusted spectral flatness combines SF and ST:
\begin{equation}
\text{SF}_{\text{adj}} = \text{SF} + (1 - \text{SF}) \cdot \text{ReLU}(\text{ST} - 0.6),
\label{eq:sf_adj}
\end{equation}
and the routing gate is:
\begin{equation}
g(t) = \sigma\!\left(T_{\text{gate}} \cdot (\text{SF}_{\text{adj}}(t) - 0.5)\right),
\label{eq:gate}
\end{equation}
where $T_{\text{gate}}$ (gate temperature, init.~5.0) is the \textbf{only learnable parameter} in the routing mechanism.
The final DualPCEN output is:
\begin{equation}
y(t) = g(t) \cdot \text{Exp}_2(x_t) + (1 - g(t)) \cdot \text{Exp}_1(x_t).
\label{eq:dualpcen_out}
\end{equation}
High $g$ (flat spectrum) routes to Expert~2 (stationary specialist); low $g$ (tonal spectrum) routes to Expert~1 (non-stationary specialist).

\subsubsection{Connection to Bayesian Mixture Model}

DualPCEN admits a Bayesian interpretation.
Let $z \in \{\text{stat}, \text{nonstat}\}$ denote the latent noise type.
The output can be written as:
\begin{multline}
p(y | x) = p(z{=}\text{s} | x)\, p(y | x, z{=}\text{s}) \\
  + \; p(z{=}\text{ns} | x)\, p(y | x, z{=}\text{ns}),
\label{eq:bayesian_mix}
\end{multline}
where s $=$ stationary and ns $=$ non-stationary,
where $p(z | x) = g(\text{SF}(x), \text{ST}(x))$ is the \emph{non-learnable posterior} over noise type, computed from signal-derived acoustic features.
This connects to SA-SSM's Bayesian state estimation (Eq.~\ref{eq:b_gate}): the frontend performs Bayesian mixture selection on the normalization, while the SSM performs Bayesian filtering on the temporal state---two complementary levels of Bayesian reasoning.

\subsubsection{Structural Advantage over CNN Normalization}

DualPCEN's per-input routing creates a fundamental structural gap between NanoMamba and CNN baselines:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item \textbf{DS-CNN-S} (global BatchNorm~\cite{ioffe2015batchnorm}): computes $\mu, \sigma^2$ over the entire training batch.
At inference, running statistics are frozen: the \emph{same} normalization is applied to clean speech and $-15$\,dB white noise.
Note that Layer Normalization~\cite{ba2016layernorm}, while computing per-instance statistics, is rarely used in small-footprint KWS due to its higher computational cost.
\item \textbf{BC-ResNet-1} (Sub-Spectral Norm): computes $\mu_f, \sigma_f^2$ per frequency sub-band---a step toward frequency awareness.
However, these sub-band statistics are still \emph{frozen running averages} at inference time.
\item \textbf{NanoMamba} (DualPCEN): computes SF and ST \emph{from the current input} and routes to the appropriate expert.
This routing is \emph{dynamic per-input at inference time}---a capability structurally absent in any BatchNorm variant.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-Learnable Architectural Guarantees}
\label{sec:guarantees}

Unconstrained optimization can destroy noise-robust properties: the optimizer, minimizing clean-data loss, may push adaptive parameters to degenerate values (e.g., $\Delta \to 0$ freezing the SSM, $\varepsilon \to 0$ eliminating residual bypass, or $\mathbf{B}$-gate $\to 0$ blocking input).
Inspired by stability analysis in nonlinear dynamical systems~\cite{khalil2002nonlinear}, we introduce three \texttt{register\_buffer} constraints---non-learnable, not part of the computation graph, and adding zero parameter overhead.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{1) Adaptive $\Delta$-floor} (temporal memory scaling):
\begin{equation}
\Delta_{\text{floor}}(\hat{s}) = \Delta_{\min} + (\Delta_{\max} - \Delta_{\min}) \cdot \bar{s},
\label{eq:delta_floor}
\end{equation}
where $\bar{s} = \text{mean}(\hat{\mathbf{s}}_t) \in [0, 1]$, $\Delta_{\min} = 0.05$, $\Delta_{\max} = 0.15$.
The effective $\Delta$ is clamped: $\Delta_t \gets \max(\Delta_t, \Delta_{\text{floor}})$.

\emph{Interpretation}: High SNR ($\bar{s} \approx 1$) $\to$ floor = 0.15 (fast state decay, responsive to input changes).
Low SNR ($\bar{s} \approx 0$) $\to$ floor = 0.05 (slow state decay, longer temporal memory to integrate over noisy frames).
This prevents the SSM from freezing ($\Delta \to 0$), ensuring the dynamical system remains active.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{2) Adaptive $\varepsilon$-bypass} (residual path):
\begin{equation}
\varepsilon(\hat{s}) = \varepsilon_{\max} - (\varepsilon_{\max} - \varepsilon_{\min}) \cdot \bar{s},
\label{eq:epsilon}
\end{equation}
where $\varepsilon_{\min} = 0.08$, $\varepsilon_{\max} = 0.20$.
The state update becomes:
\begin{equation}
\mathbf{h}_t = \bar{\mathbf{A}}_t \, \mathbf{h}_{t-1} + \bar{\mathbf{B}}_t \, x_t + \varepsilon_t \cdot x_t.
\label{eq:eps_update}
\end{equation}

\emph{Interpretation}: When $\Delta$-modulation and $\mathbf{B}$-gating jointly suppress input under extreme noise, the $\varepsilon$-bypass ensures a minimum fraction of the input always flows through, preventing catastrophic signal collapse.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{3) $\mathbf{B}$-gate floor}:
\begin{equation}
\tilde{g}_B = g_B \cdot (1 - g_{\text{floor}}) + g_{\text{floor}}, \quad g_{\text{floor}} = 0.3,
\label{eq:bgate_floor}
\end{equation}
constraining the effective $\mathbf{B}$-gate to $[0.3, 1.0]$.

\emph{Interpretation}: Prevents compound over-suppression when both $\Delta$-modulation and $\mathbf{B}$-gating simultaneously attenuate input, guaranteeing minimum 30\% input flow at extreme noise.


\subsection{Runtime Parameter Calibration}
\label{sec:calibration}

The three architectural guarantees ($\Delta$-floor, $\varepsilon$-bypass, $\mathbf{B}$-gate floor) use \texttt{register\_buffer} values that can be adjusted at deployment time based on the noise environment.
We define four calibration profiles:

\begin{table}[t]
\centering
\caption{Runtime calibration profiles. Parameters are set during silence/VAD periods based on estimated noise level.}
\label{tab:calibration}
\small
\setlength{\tabcolsep}{3pt}
\begin{tabular}{lccccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Profile} & $\Delta_{\min}$ & $\Delta_{\max}$ & $\varepsilon_{\min}$ & $\varepsilon_{\max}$ & $g_{\text{floor}}$ \\
\midrule
Clean ($>$20\,dB)     & 0.15 & 0.15 & 0.08 & 0.08 & 0.0 \\
Light (10--20\,dB)    & 0.08 & 0.15 & 0.08 & 0.15 & 0.2 \\
Moderate (0--10\,dB)  & 0.05 & 0.15 & 0.10 & 0.20 & 0.3 \\
Extreme ($<$0\,dB)    & 0.02 & 0.15 & 0.15 & 0.30 & 0.5 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Profile selection occurs during silence/VAD periods using the same SF and SNR features already computed by DualPCEN and SA-SSM, adding zero computational overhead.
This enables deployment-time adaptation without retraining or over-the-air model updates.


\subsection{Spectral Subtraction with SNR-Adaptive Bypass}
\label{sec:ss_bypass}

As a complementary zero-parameter front-end inspired by classical adaptive filtering theory~\cite{haykin2014adaptive}, we apply spectral subtraction~\cite{boll1979suppression,loizou2013speech}:
\begin{equation}
|\hat{S}_{f,t}|^2 = \max\!\left(|X_{f,t}|^2 - \beta \cdot |\hat{N}_f|^2, \;\gamma \cdot |X_{f,t}|^2\right),
\label{eq:ss}
\end{equation}
where $\hat{N}_f$ is estimated from the first $K{=}5$ frames, $\beta{=}2.0$ is the over-subtraction factor, and $\gamma{=}0.1$ is the spectral floor.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{SNR-adaptive bypass.}
Spectral subtraction improves noisy speech but can degrade clean speech through over-subtraction artifacts.
We address this with an SNR-adaptive bypass gate:
\begin{equation}
x_{\text{out}} = g_{\text{bypass}} \cdot x_{\text{original}} + (1 - g_{\text{bypass}}) \cdot x_{\text{enhanced}},
\label{eq:bypass}
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
g_{\text{bypass}} = \sigma\!\left(\tau \cdot (\widehat{\text{SNR}} - \theta)\right),
\label{eq:bypass_gate}
\end{equation}
with threshold $\theta = 10$\,dB and steepness $\tau = 0.5$.
High SNR ($\gg \theta$) $\to$ $g \approx 1$ (original preserved); low SNR ($\ll \theta$) $\to$ $g \approx 0$ (enhanced output used).
This achieves both clean preservation and noise improvement with zero trainable parameters.


\subsection{NanoMamba Architecture Summary}
\label{sec:arch_summary}

Figure~\ref{fig:system} illustrates the complete NanoMamba pipeline.
Given 1-second audio at 16\,kHz, we compute: (1)~a 40-band mel spectrogram via STFT (512-point FFT, 160-sample hop), (2)~per-band SNR estimates from a lightweight estimator.
The mel features pass through spectral subtraction with SNR bypass, DualPCEN routing, and instance normalization, then are projected and processed by $L$ stacked SA-SSM blocks.
Global average pooling and a linear classifier produce 12-class logits.

% IV. TRAINING STRATEGY
% ============================================================
\section{Per-Sample Multi-Condition Training}
\label{sec:training}

\subsection{Per-Sample vs.\ Per-Batch Noise Mixing}

Standard multi-condition training~\cite{ko2015audio} applies the \emph{same} noise type and SNR to all samples within a mini-batch~\cite{rybakov2020streaming}.
While SpecAugment~\cite{park2019specaugment} provides effective frequency-time masking for clean-data augmentation, it does not simulate realistic noise environments.
Standard per-batch noise mixing provides sparse gradient information: each update step sees only one noise condition, requiring many epochs for DualPCEN's routing to encounter the full diversity of noise types.

We propose \textbf{per-sample noise mixing}: each sample in a mini-batch independently draws:
(1)~a noise type uniformly from $\{\text{factory}, \text{white}, \text{babble}, \text{street}, \text{pink}\}$, and
(2)~an SNR value uniformly from a curriculum-determined range.
With batch size $B$, each gradient update contains up to $B$ distinct noise conditions, providing \emph{combinatorial diversity} that accelerates DualPCEN routing learning.

\subsection{Curriculum Schedule}

Training proceeds in four phases:
\begin{enumerate}
\setlength\itemsep{0pt}
\item \textbf{Warm-up} (epochs 0--2): Clean-only training.
Stabilizes the Expert~1 pathway in DualPCEN and establishes baseline BatchNorm statistics for CNN baselines.
\item \textbf{Gentle} (epochs 3--9): Noise ratio ramps from 0 to the target ratio (default 50\%), SNR range 5--15\,dB.
Gradually exposes the Expert~2 pathway without disrupting clean features.
\item \textbf{Moderate} (epochs 10--19): Full noise ratio, SNR 0--10\,dB.
Both DualPCEN experts are fully engaged, routing matures.
\item \textbf{Hard} (epochs 20+): Full noise ratio, SNR $-5$ to 10\,dB.
Extreme conditions harden both pathways.
\end{enumerate}

For CNN baselines, we additionally reduce BatchNorm momentum from 0.1 (warm-up) to 0.05 (noise phases) to stabilize running statistics under the changed input distribution.

\subsection{Why NanoMamba Benefits Disproportionately}
\label{sec:why_disproportionate}

The structural argument for why per-sample noise-aug training benefits NanoMamba more than CNNs is as follows:

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{CNN (trade-off).}
CNN models have a single set of convolutional kernels and normalization statistics.
Multi-condition training forces these shared resources to handle both clean and noisy patterns simultaneously.
BatchNorm running statistics shift to reflect the \emph{average} of clean and noisy distributions---a compromise that improves noise robustness at the cost of clean accuracy.
This is a zero-sum trade-off inherent in fixed-kernel, fixed-statistic architectures.

\smallskip\noindent\textbf{NanoMamba (no trade-off).}
DualPCEN provides two \emph{separate} processing pathways with dynamic routing.
Per-sample noise-aug training teaches:
(1)~Expert~1 to specialize on clean/non-stationary inputs (low SF),
(2)~Expert~2 to specialize on stationary-noise inputs (high SF), and
(3)~the SA-SSM's $\Delta$-modulation and $\mathbf{B}$-gating to activate under noise.
Because routing is dynamic per-input, Expert~1 can maintain clean performance while Expert~2 independently improves noise robustness---\emph{no trade-off} is necessary.

This is a testable prediction: we expect noise-aug training to improve NanoMamba's noise accuracy \emph{without degrading} clean accuracy, while CNN baselines will exhibit an accuracy trade-off.


% ============================================================
% V. EXPERIMENTAL SETUP
% ============================================================
\section{Experimental Setup}
\label{sec:setup}

\subsection{Dataset}

We evaluate on Google Speech Commands V2~\cite{warden2018speech} with the standard 12-class task (10 keywords + silence + unknown): 86,843 training / 10,481 validation / 11,505 test utterances at 16\,kHz.

\subsection{Noise Conditions}

Five noise types are evaluated:
\textbf{factory} (machine hum at 50--250\,Hz harmonics, conveyor rumble, impact transients),
\textbf{white} (Gaussian, spectrally flat),
\textbf{babble} (5--9 randomly mixed training utterances),
\textbf{street} (traffic rumble, horn impulses, road noise), and
\textbf{pink} ($1/f$ spectrum).
Factory, street, and babble noise are generated procedurally following standard protocols~\cite{snyder2015musan}, while white and pink noise are synthesized analytically.
Noise is mixed at target SNR using RMS-based scaling at levels $\{-15, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10, 15\}$\,dB, yielding $5 \times 7 = 35$ noise conditions plus clean.

\subsection{Baselines}

We compare against:
(1)~DS-CNN-S~\cite{zhang2017hello} (23,756 params, global BatchNorm),
(2)~BC-ResNet-1~\cite{kim2021bcresnet} (7,464 params, Sub-Spectral Norm), and
(3)~ablated NanoMamba variants (without DualPCEN, without guarantees, without spectral subtraction).
All models are trained both clean-only and with per-sample noise augmentation, using identical noise conditions for fair comparison.

\subsection{Training Details}

All models are trained for 30 epochs with AdamW~\cite{loshchilov2019adamw} ($\beta_1{=}0.9$, $\beta_2{=}0.999$), cosine annealing~\cite{loshchilov2017sgdr} (initial LR $3{\times}10^{-3}$), label smoothing 0.1~\cite{szegedy2016rethinking}, batch size 128, and gradient clipping at 1.0.
Data augmentation includes time shift ($\pm$100\,ms), volume perturbation ($\pm$20\%), and light Gaussian noise ($p{=}0.3$, $\sigma{=}0.005$).
For noise-augmented models, the per-sample curriculum described in Section~\ref{sec:training} is applied with noise ratio 0.5.

% VII. ANALYSIS
% ============================================================
\section{Structural Analysis}
\label{sec:analysis}

\subsection{DualPCEN Routing Analysis}

% TODO: Fill with routing analysis results from Colab
% Key figure: gate values for clean vs noisy inputs
% Show routing separation as evidence of structural advantage

The DualPCEN routing analysis provides the most direct evidence for the structural advantage claim.
By measuring the average gate value $\bar{g}$ for clean inputs versus various noisy inputs, we quantify the degree to which DualPCEN dynamically adapts its normalization strategy.

A large \emph{routing separation}---defined as $|\bar{g}_{\text{noisy}} - \bar{g}_{\text{clean}}|$---indicates that DualPCEN effectively discriminates between noise conditions \emph{without any noise-type labels or noise-augmented training}.
This is the ``smoking gun'' evidence for structural noise adaptation: the routing automatically classifies the noise environment using physically interpretable spectral features.

Critically, CNN baselines have \emph{no equivalent mechanism}: DS-CNN-S applies the same global BatchNorm statistics to all inputs, and BC-ResNet-1's Sub-Spectral Norm uses frozen sub-band statistics.
Neither architecture can perform per-input adaptive normalization at inference time.

\subsection{Architectural Guarantee Analysis}

% TODO: Show what happens when guarantees are removed
% Training curves: with vs without delta-floor, epsilon, bgate-floor

The three architectural guarantees ($\Delta$-floor, $\varepsilon$-bypass, $\mathbf{B}$-gate floor) serve as stability constraints for the SSM dynamical system.
Without $\Delta_{\text{floor}}$, the optimizer may push $\Delta \to 0$, effectively freezing the SSM state ($\mathbf{h}_t \approx \mathbf{h}_{t-1}$) and eliminating temporal dynamics.
Without $\varepsilon$-bypass, extreme noise can cause compound input suppression through joint $\Delta$-modulation and $\mathbf{B}$-gating, leading to catastrophic signal loss.
Without $g_{\text{floor}}$, the $\mathbf{B}$-gate can fully close, blocking all new input from entering the state---equivalent to a disconnected dynamical system.

\subsection{Spectral Subtraction Bypass Analysis}

% TODO: Show SNR-adaptive bypass effect
% Clean: bypass preserves original → no degradation
% Noisy: spectral subtraction applied → improved robustness


% ============================================================
% VIII. DISCUSSION
% ============================================================
\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Structural vs.\ Training-Based Robustness}

Our results reveal a fundamental distinction between \emph{structural} noise robustness (arising from architectural design) and \emph{training-based} robustness (arising from noise-augmented training data).
NanoMamba provides both: SA-SSM and DualPCEN deliver structural robustness that requires no noise during training, while per-sample noise-aug training further improves performance.
Crucially, these two forms of robustness are \emph{complementary}: DualPCEN's dynamic routing enables more effective noise-aug training by providing separate pathways for clean and noisy patterns.

CNN architectures, in contrast, can only access training-based robustness.
Their fixed kernels and frozen normalization statistics force a clean-noise trade-off during noise-aug training, limiting the achievable noise improvement without clean degradation.

\subsection{Deployment Considerations}

NanoMamba-Tiny-DualPCEN's 4,957 parameters (4.8\,KB INT8) fit comfortably within MCU SRAM budgets of 64--256\,KB, well within the constraints established by MCUNet~\cite{lin2020mcunet} and on-device training frameworks~\cite{lin2022ondevice}.
The SSM state per layer is only $d_{\text{inner}} \times N = 24 \times 4 = 96$ values, enabling streaming inference with negligible memory overhead.
INT8 quantization~\cite{rusci2020memory} is directly applicable to the register-buffer guarantees since they are stored as fixed-point constants.
Runtime calibration provides deployment-time adaptation through a simple register update during VAD-detected silence periods, requiring no OTA model updates.
Future work could combine NanoMamba with knowledge distillation~\cite{hinton2015distilling,kim2022qbyod} to further compress the model while maintaining noise robustness.

\subsection{Limitations and Future Work}

The current evaluation uses a single dataset (GSC V2) with synthetically generated noise.
Future work will include: (1)~evaluation on additional datasets (GSC V1, Korean KWS corpora), (2)~real-world noise recordings, (3)~on-device profiling on ARM Cortex-M4/M7 and Jetson Nano, (4)~extension to more than two DualPCEN experts, and (5)~investigation of DualPCEN routing for other audio tasks beyond KWS.

% IX. CONCLUSION
% ============================================================
\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We presented NanoMamba, an ultra-compact state space model that achieves noise robustness as an \emph{inherent structural property} through three complementary mechanisms: Spectral-Aware SSM (SA-SSM) for adaptive temporal dynamics, DualPCEN for dual-expert noise-adaptive normalization with zero-learnable-parameter routing, and non-learnable architectural guarantees preventing optimizer destruction of noise-robust properties.

% TODO: Add final numbers from Colab results
% Key result: NanoMamba-Tiny-DualPCEN (4,957 params) achieves X% retention at 0dB
% DualPCEN routing analysis confirms per-input adaptive normalization
% Noise-aug training shows no clean-noise trade-off for NanoMamba

The DualPCEN routing analysis provides direct evidence that NanoMamba dynamically adapts its normalization strategy per-input at inference time---a structural capability fundamentally absent in CNN architectures with frozen BatchNorm statistics.
Combined with per-sample noise-augmented training, which reveals NanoMamba's disproportionate benefit from dynamic routing, these results establish that ultra-compact SSMs with structural noise adaptation represent a principled approach to noise-robust edge KWS.
